## Introduction
My first python project. A simple Tic Tac Toe game that can be played by two players on the same computer. The game board is displayed after each move, and players take turns inputting their positions on the board.

## How to Play
- **Setup**: When the game starts, you will be prompted to choose whether Player 1 wants to be 'X' or 'O'. The other player will be assigned the remaining marker.
- **Game Start**: The game will randomly choose which player goes first.
- **Turns**: Players take turns to input their desired position on the board (choose a number between 1 and 9).
- **Winning**: The game checks after each move if there's a winner or if the board is full, resulting in a tie.

HAVE FUN!
